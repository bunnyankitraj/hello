# hello

This makes the difficult task of printing "Hello, World!" to the terminal very easy.

No longer do you have to type in `print('Hello, World!')`.

All you have to do is `pip install git+https://github.com/johnlarson/hello.git`, and write the following python code:

```
from hello import say_hello

say_hello()
```

Then, when you run the above code, 'Hello, World!' will be printed to the screen.
